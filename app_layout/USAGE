Description:
    The app_layout generator creates a basic stylesheet and layout
    which will give some structure to a starting Rails app.

    The generator takes one argument which will be the name of the
    layout and stylesheet files. Default is `application`.

Options:
    --no-css  No CSS file made

Examples:
    ./script/generate app_layout

        This will create two files:
            Layout:     app/views/layouts/application.rhtml
            Stylesheet: public/stylesheets/application.css


    ./script/generate app_layout myname --no-css

        This will create one file:
            Layout:     app/views/layouts/myname.rhtml
